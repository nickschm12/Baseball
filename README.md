# Baseball
The goal of this project was to find correlations between certain statistics and potentially determine some bellweather statistics.

To get started you should do the following:
1. Have miniconda installed: https://conda.io/docs/install/quick.html
2. Once you have miniconda installed you should install the libraries needed for this project:
	  conda install pandas
	  conda install scipy
	  conda install bokeh

After you have all the libraries in place you should be able to start using stat_correlation_graph.py!

To run it use `python stat_correlation_graph.py`. The script will prompt you for what type of player (Batter or Pitcher), their position, and then two categories to graph. Once you select the second category the bokeh library should open up a new tab on your web browser and display the graph.

Please let me know if you have any questions or enhancements (nickschm12@gmail.com).
