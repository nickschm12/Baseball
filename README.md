# Baseball
The new vision for this page is to track work related to fantasy baseball statistics

To get started using stat_correlation_graph.py you should do the following:
* Have miniconda installed: https://conda.io/docs/install/quick.html
* Once you have miniconda installed you should install the libraries needed for this project:
	* conda install pandas
	* conda install scipy
	* conda install bokeh

After you have all the libraries in place you should be able to start using these scripts!

To run it use `python stat_correlation_graph.py`. The script will prompt you for what type of player (Batter or Pitcher), their position, and then two categories to graph. Once you select the second category the bokeh library should open up a new tab on your web browser and display the graph.

More info will be coming for using team_stats_generator.py...

Please let me know if you have any questions or enhancements (nickschm12@gmail.com).
